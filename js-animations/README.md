## Folder Layout

Each project in this folder is organized as follows:

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that renders the animation.
- **`script.js`**: JavaScript file containing the code for the animations.
- **`style.css`**: CSS file for styling the animation and its container.
- **`README.md`**: This file, which provides details about the project.

## How to View Projects

To explore any JavaScript animation project:

1. Open the project folder.
2. Launch `index.html` in your web browser to view the animation in action.

## Project Highlights

### 1. **Walking Lego Character Animation**
- **Description**: An animated Lego character that walks forward on the screen, disappears, and leaves behind a text message. This project demonstrates how to use HTML and CSS for character design and vanilla JavaScript for animation.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Animated Character**: Realistic walking movements of the Lego character.
  - **Alternating Movements**: Alternating the position of legs and arms for a convincing walking effect.
  - **Text Reveal**: A text message appears when the character disappears.
- **Challenges Faced**:
  - **Animating Character**: Creating smooth and realistic walking movements.
  - **Positioning Elements**: Aligning the character's limbs correctly.
  - **Rhythm and Pace**: Fine-tuning the walking rhythm and speed.
  - **Text Reveal**: Timing the text reveal with the character's disappearance.
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - **JavaScript Animation**: Utilized JavaScript for animating the character's walking motion.
  - **Element Positioning**: Precisely positioned limbs to simulate walking.
  - **Timing**: Synchronized animation and text reveal for a seamless experience.

### 2. **Analog Clock with Random Mood Display**
- **Description**: A virtual reproduction of a Swatch analog watch that includes a random mood display on page load. JavaScript's Date object is used for real-time clock functionality, and rotation angles are calculated for the clock hands.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Real-Time Clock**: Hour, minute, and second hands update in real-time.
  - **Random Mood Display**: Shows a random mood message on page load.
  - **Accurate Time**: Clock hands reflect the current time with precise angle calculations.
  - **Smooth Animations**: CSS animations for clock hand movements.
- **Challenges Faced**:
  - **Angle Calculation**: Calculating accurate angles for clock hands.
  - **CSS Animation**: Implementing smooth transitions for clock hand movement.
  - **Conditional Logic**: Adjusting hour hand angle based on minute hand position.
  - **Clock Design**: Designing a circular and visually appealing clock.
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - **JavaScript Date Object**: Used for real-time timekeeping and angle calculations.
  - **CSS Animation**: Applied CSS for smooth and fluid hand movements.
  - **Conditional Logic**: Incorporated logic for accurate hour hand adjustment.
  - **Design Skills**: Designed a functional and aesthetically pleasing clock.
