# Sunburst Pattern Canvas

## Overview

The **Sunburst Pattern Canvas** project creates a dynamic sunburst pattern on a canvas using p5.js. The project features a central circle representing the sun, with rays extending outward in a radial pattern. The rays are drawn with varying lengths, creating a visually engaging effect. The canvas background is a cyan color, while the sun and rays are rendered in yellow. The pattern is updated at a low frame rate to enhance the visual effect.

## How to View

To view the Sunburst Pattern Canvas project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nada-TB/creative-coding-projects.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd creative-coding-projects/p5.js-projects/sunburst-pattern-canvas
    ```

3. **Open the Project**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the sunburst pattern on the canvas.

4. **View the Files**: The `style.css` file contains the CSS styling for the canvas and layout. The `sketch.js` file includes the p5.js code responsible for drawing the sunburst pattern.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

    |-- sunburst-pattern-canvas/
        |-- index.html
        |-- style.css
        |-- sketch.js
        |-- README.md

## Description

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for embedding the p5.js canvas.
- **CSS**: Styles the canvas and centers it on the page. It also sets the width and margin for the canvas container.
- **JavaScript (p5.js)**: The `sketch.js` file initializes the canvas and sets the frame rate. The `draw` function creates a sunburst pattern by drawing a central circle and extending rays outward using trigonometric calculations. The rays vary in length, and the pattern is redrawn at a low frame rate to create a dynamic effect.
