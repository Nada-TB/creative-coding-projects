# Grid Pattern Circle Canvas

## Overview

The **Grid Pattern Circle Canvas** project demonstrates how to create a grid pattern of circles on a canvas using p5.js. Each circle is drawn at evenly spaced intervals to form a grid-like pattern, creating a visually appealing design. The canvas is initialized with a yellow background, and the circles are rendered in white. This project highlights the use of nested loops to create regular patterns and manage drawing operations on a canvas.

## How to View

To view the Grid Pattern Circle Canvas project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nada-TB/creative-coding-projects.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd creative-coding-projects/p5.js-projects/grid-pattern-circle-canvas
    ```

3. **Open the Project**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the canvas with the grid pattern of circles.

4. **View the Files**: The `style.css` file contains the CSS styling for the canvas and layout. The `sketch.js` file includes the p5.js code responsible for drawing the grid pattern.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

    |-- grid-pattern-circle-canvas/
        |-- index.html
        |-- style.css
        |-- sketch.js
        |-- README.md

## Description

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for embedding the p5.js canvas.
- **CSS**: Styles the canvas and centers it on the page. It also sets the width and margin for the canvas container.
- **JavaScript (p5.js)**: The `sketch.js` file initializes the canvas with a yellow background and uses nested loops in the `draw` function to render a grid of circles. The circles are evenly spaced and have a fixed diameter of 10 pixels.
