# Dynamic Random Color Squares Canvas

## Overview

The **Dynamic Random Color Squares Canvas** project features a p5.js sketch that creates a vibrant display of squares with randomly assigned colors and positions on a canvas. This dynamic visual effect is achieved by continuously drawing squares with varying colors at random locations. The sketch runs for a predefined number of frames (1000), after which it stops, leaving a colorful static image. This project showcases the ability to use p5.js for generating random, interactive graphical content.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

    |-- dynamic-random-color-squares-canvas/

        |-- sketch.js
        |-- README.md

## Description

- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure for embedding the p5.js canvas.
- **CSS**: Styles the canvas and centers it on the page. It also sets the width and margin for the canvas container.
- **JavaScript (p5.js)**: The `sketch.js` file creates the canvas and defines the drawing behavior. The `draw` function randomly generates colors and positions for squares and continuously updates the canvas until 1000 frames have been drawn, at which point the drawing stops
