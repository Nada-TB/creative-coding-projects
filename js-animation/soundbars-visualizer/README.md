# SoundBars Visualizer

## Overview

The **SoundBars Visualizer** project features a dynamic animation of moving bars that react to user interaction. When the user clicks the "Play" button, the bars animate to simulate a visual representation of sound waves or beats. This project demonstrates how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually engaging and interactive audio effect.
