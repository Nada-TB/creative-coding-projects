## How to View

To view the AnimateCursor project:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the animated text effect.
2. The `style.css` file contains the CSS styling for the text and cursor.
3. The `script.js` file includes the JavaScript code responsible for animating the text.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

    |-- js-animations/

        |-- style.css
        |-- script.js
        |-- README.md

## Description

- **HTML**: Contains a paragraph with a span element where the animated text and cursor are displayed.
- **CSS**: Styles the text and background to create a visually appealing typewriter effect, including text size, color, and background gradient.
- **JavaScript**: The script animates the text by simulating a typewriter effect. It cycles through an array of strings, adding one character at a time to the span element and then resetting to the next string.
