## Overview

The **Heart Animation** project creates an interactive heart animation effect. When you click on the heart icon, it triggers the creation of additional hearts around it with a dynamic animation. This project showcases the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create visually engaging animations and interactions.
