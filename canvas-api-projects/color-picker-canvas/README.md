# Color Picker Canvas

## Overview

The **Color Picker Canvas** project showcases an interactive canvas element that allows users to pick colors from a gradient and change the text color dynamically based on their selection.

## Description

- **HTML**: Sets up the Canvas element within a `div`, along with a heading instructing users on how to interact with the color picker.
- **CSS**: Styles the Canvas border, the container `div`, and centers the heading text.
- **JavaScript**: Utilizes the Canvas API to create a linear gradient that transitions from red to green to blue. The script listens for click events on the Canvas, retrieves the color at the clicked position, and updates the color of the heading text accordingly.
