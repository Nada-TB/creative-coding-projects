## Description

- **HTML**: Provides a `<canvas>` element within a `<div>` container where the color grid animation takes place.
- **CSS**: Styles the canvas and container with a border and centering.
- **JavaScript**: Uses the Canvas API to create and update a grid of colored squares. The `colorGridRandomly` function updates the grid colors at a specified interval using `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations.

## Project Highlights

- **Dynamic Color Changes**: The canvas grid dynamically updates with random colors at a specified interval.
- **Smooth Animation**: Utilizes `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth, efficient animations.
- **Canvas API**: Demonstrates the use of the Canvas API for creating and updating graphics.

## Additional Information

- **Canvas API**: The Canvas API provides a powerful way to create graphics and animations directly in the browser.
- **Performance**: Using `requestAnimationFrame` ensures that animations are rendered smoothly and efficiently.
