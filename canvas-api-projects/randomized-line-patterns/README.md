# Randomized Line Patterns

## Overview

The **Randomized Line Patterns** project generates a vibrant and dynamic visual effect on an HTML5 Canvas element. The project utilizes the Canvas API to create a grid of lines with randomly assigned colors and transparency levels, resulting in a visually intriguing pattern.

## Description

- **HTML**: Provides a `div` containing a Canvas element where the patterns are drawn.
- **CSS**: Styles the Canvas border and centers the container `div` on the page.
- **JavaScript**: Uses the Canvas API to draw lines across the canvas with randomized colors and transparency. The script iterates through each pixel on the canvas, creating a new line segment with a unique color and opacity for each step.
